| DB Type                       | Example DBs              | Typical Read QPS (Simple)                 | Typical Write/Insert QPS  | Notes/Benchmarks                                                                                                        |

| Relational (OLTP/SQL)         | MySQL, PostgreSQL        | 1k–10k (e.g., 5k on AWS RDS with indexes) | 500–5k (batched inserts)  | MySQL: ~2k–4k QPS in Sysbench tests; Postgres: similar, but drops under 1k for complex joins.                           |
| NoSQL Key-Value/Document      | Redis, MongoDB           | 50k–200k+ (Redis in-memory)               | 10k–100k (Mongo for docs) | Redis: Up to 100k+ ops/sec for GET/SET; Mongo: 10k–50k inserts/sec in benchmarks, but degrades with large docs.         |
| Wide-Column/NoSQL Distributed | Cassandra                | 5k–50k                                    | 10k–100k+ (high writes)   | Cassandra shines on writes (e.g., 50k+ in YCSB tests); reads slower without tuning.                                     |
| OLAP/Analytics                | ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot | 100–25k+ (analytics queries)              | 10k–1M+ rows/sec ingest   | ClickHouse: 25k+ QPS at <100ms P99 for logs/analytics; ingest often 100k–240B rows/sec in aggregates (e.g., via Kafka). |
