## When to choose batch data pipelines

**Periodic reporting**: For scheduled reports and analytics on historical data.
**Large scale transformations**: For massive datasets that require cleaning, aggregation, and transformation.
**Data warehousing**: For loading and updating data warehouses from various sources.
**Data migration**: For moving large volumes of data between systems or from on-prem to cloud.
Scheduled backups: For creating regular, large-scale data backups for disaster recovery or archival.
