Week 1:

Creating a Data Warehouse Through Joins and Unions

Instead of using `UNION or UNION ALL`, we can use wildcard filter with `_TABLE_SUFFIX` filter
example:
```
SELECT * FROM ecommerce.sales_by_sku_20170801
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM ecommerce.sales_by_sku_20170802
```
can use:
```
SELECT * FROM `ecommerce.sales_by_sku_2017*`
(WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX = '0802')
```
