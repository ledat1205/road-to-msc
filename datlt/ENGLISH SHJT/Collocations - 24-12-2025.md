My friend Abigail is **desperately worried** about her son at the moment. He wants to enrol on a course of **some sort** but just can’t **make a decision** about what to study. I gave Abigail a ring and we **had a long chat** about it last night. She said he’d like to study for a degree but is afraid he won’t **meet the requirements** for **university entry**. Abigail thinks he should **do a course** in Management because he’d like to **set up his own business** in the future. I agreed that that would be **a wise choice**.
