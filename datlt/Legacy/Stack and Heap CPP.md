Memory divided into a few different segments:
- code segment: where the compiled program sits in the memory. This segment is typically read-only
- bss segment (the uninitialized data segment): where zero-initialized global and static variables are stored
- data segment (the initialized data segment): where initialized global and static variables are stored 
- the heap:
